,,"May an officer accompany an individual inside their home when they are under",,,,,"Yes.  24","The Court began by stating that the “‘plain view’ exception to the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement permits a law enforcement officer to seize what clearly is incriminating evidence or contraband when it is discovered in a place where the officer has a right to be.”74 The Court stated that Daughtery “had a right to remain literally at Overdahl’s elbow at all times; nothing in the Fourth Amendment is to the contrary.” The Washington Court’s “premise … [was] that Officer Daughtery was not entitled to accompany Overdahl from the public corridor of the dormitory into his room, absent a showing that such ‘intervention’ was required by ‘exigent circumstances.’” The Supreme Court, however, “disagree[d] with this novel reading of the Fourth Amendment.” It went on to say that the “absence of an affirmative indication that an arrested person might have a weapon available or might attempt to escape does not diminish the arresting officer’s authority to maintain custody over the arrested person” and “that authority [is not] altered by the nature of the offense for which the arrest was made.” The Court noted that “[e]very arrest must be presumed to present a risk of danger to the arresting officer” and “[t]here is no way for an officer to predict reliably how a particular subject will react to arrest or the degree of the potential danger.” The Court concluded that it was “not ‘unreasonable’ under the Fourth Amendment for a police officer, as a matter of routine, to monitor the movements of an arrested person, as his judgment dictates, following the arrest.” As such, Daugherty’s presence in the room was lawful, and thus his plain view of the contraband was also lawful. The Court stated that “[t]his is a classic instance of incriminating evidence found in plain view when a police officer, for unrelated but entirely legitimate reasons, obtains lawful access to an individual’s area of privacy.” In that situation, the “Fourth Amendment does not prohibit seizure of evidence of criminal conduct found in these circumstances.”","ARREST",3
"Welsh v. Wisconsin","466 U.S. 740","Welsh v. Wisconsin, 466 U.S. 740 (1984)",,"U.S. Supreme Court","On April 24, 1978, a witness “observed a car being driven erratically.” Eventually, it swerved off the road and stopped in an open field. The witness was concerned about the driver and that he would “get back on the highway.” He placed his own vehicle to block in the suspect’s vehicle and asked a passerby to call for the police. However, before the police arrived, the driver of the suspect vehicle got out and asked the witness for a ride home, but the witness “suggested that they wait for assistance in removing or repairing the car.” Instead, the driver walked away from the scene. When the police arrived, they talked to the witness, and he explained what had occurred. The officer checked on the ownership of the vehicle and learned that Welsh was the registered owner and lived only a short distance away. The police proceeded to the Welsh home, arriving at about 2100. Welsh’s stepdaughter answered the door and admitted the officers. They found Welsh upstairs, naked, in bed, and arrested him for driving under the influence. He was taken to the station and refused to submit to breath testing, which subjected him to a greater penalty.  25  The Wisconsin’s trial court concluded that Welsh’s arrest was lawful and his refusal to submit to breath testing unreasonable.",,,,"ARREST",3
,,"May officers make a warrantless probable cause arrest, inside a home, absent",,,,,"No.","The Court began its opinion by stating that “‘physical entry of the home is the chief evil against which the wording of the Fourth Amendment is directed.’” One of the principal protections “against unnecessary intrusions into private dwellings is the warrant requirement imposed by the Fourth Amendment on agents of the government who seek to enter the house for purposes of search or arrest.” The Court has held that “searches and seizures inside a home without a warrant are presumptively unreasonable” unless an exigent circumstance exists, and those are “few in number and carefully delineated.” The Court noted that its “hesitation in finding exigent circumstances, especially when warrantless arrests in the home are at issue, is particularly appropriate when the underlying offense for which there is probable cause is relatively minor, and “[b]efore agents of the government may invade the sanctity of the home, the burden is on the government to demonstrate exigent circumstances that overcome the presumption of unreasonableness that attaches to all warrantless home entries.” At the time this offense occurred, Wisconsin classified driving under the influence as a noncriminal, traffic offense, for which no jail time was possible. A “warrantless home arrest cannot be upheld simply because evidence of [Welsh’s] blood-alcohol level might have dissipated while the police obtained a warrant.”","ARREST",3
,,"Arrest Warrants",,"U.S. Supreme Court","On January 14, 1970, after a lengthy investigation, New York officers had probable cause to arrest Payton in a murder. Without a warrant, the officers went to Payton’s apartment. Although the lights were on and music was playing, there was no answer to their knock. They broke down the door, but no one was there. However, in plain view, there was a shell casing that they seized and later used in Payton’s trial. Payton appealed the entry and seizure of the shell casing, which was important evidence in the trial, but the state courts upheld his conviction.",,,,"ARREST",3
,,"Absent exigent circumstances, may officers enter a residence for the purpose of",,,,,"No","The warrantless arrest of a person is a seizure the Fourth Amendment requires to be reasonable. “[T]he physical entry of the home is the chief evil against which the wording of the Fourth Amendment is directed … we have long adhered to the view that the warrant procedure minimizes the danger of needless intrusions of that sort.” “In terms that equally apply to seizures of property and to seizures of persons, the Fourth Amendment has drawn a firm line at the entrance to the house. Absent exigent circumstances, that threshold may not reasonably be crossed without a warrant.”","ARREST",3
,,"Absent exigent circumstances or consent, may a law enforcement officer legally",,,,,"No.","The agents relied on the arrest warrant as legal authority to enter the home of a third person based on their belief that Lyons may be a guest there. Regardless of how reasonable this belief may have been, it was never subjected to the scrutiny of a detached judicial officer. The Court found that to hold otherwise would allow officers armed only with an arrest warrant to search the homes of the suspect’s friends and relatives, thereby violating their reasonable expectation of privacy in their own homes.  27  SEIZURE","ARREST",3
,,"Is the involuntary transportation of someone to a police station a seizure?",,,,"Is the involuntary transportation of someone to a police station a seizure?","Yes.","The Court held that “there [could] be little doubt that [Dunaway] was ‘seized’ in the Fourth Amendment sense when he was taken involuntarily to the police station.” The prosecution conceded that “the police lacked probable cause to arrest [Dunaway] before his incriminating statement during interrogation.” However, the government argued that the “seizure of [Dunaway] did not amount to an arrest and was therefore permissible under the Fourth Amendment because the police had a ‘reasonable suspicion’ that [Dunaway] possessed ‘intimate knowledge about a serious and unsolved crime.’” In this situation, the “detention of [Dunaway] was in important respects indistinguishable from a traditional arrest.” Just because he “was not told he was under arrest, was not ‘booked,’ and would not have had an arrest record if the interrogation had proved fruitless, while not insignificant for all purposes … obviously do not make [Dunaway’s] seizure even roughly analogous to the narrowly defined intrusions involved in Terry and its progeny.”","ARREST",3
"Scott v. Harris","550 U.S. 372","Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372 (2007)",,"U.S. Supreme Court","In late March 2001, a deputy sheriff in Coweta County, Georgia, “clocked [Harris’s] vehicle traveling at 73 miles per hour on a road with a 55-mile-per-hour speed limit.” The deputy activated his emergency equipment and tried to pull the vehicle over, but instead, it “sped away, initiating a chase down what is in most portions a two-lane road, at speeds exceeding 85 miles per hour.” Deputy Scott and others joined in the chase. At one point, the responding officers tried to box in the Harris vehicle, and Harris “evaded the trap by making a sharp turn, colliding with Scott’s police car” and escaped. Scott then took over as the lead vehicle76 and six minutes, and ten miles, into the chase, Scott made an “attempt to terminate the episode by employing a 28  “Precision Intervention Technique (‘PIT’) maneuver, which cause[d] the fleeing vehicle to spin to a stop.” Scott was instructed by his supervisor to “[g]o ahead and take him out.” Scott then “applied his push bumper to the rear of [Harris’s] vehicle” and Harris “lost control of [the] vehicle, which left the roadway, ran down an embankment, overturned, and crashed.” Harris was badly injured and was rendered a quadriplegic. Harris filed suit under 42 U.S.C. §1983, arguing that his injuries were caused by excessive use of force by Deputy Scott. Scott filed for summary judgment, but the U.S. District Court in the Northern District of Georgia denied the motion, finding that there were “material issues of fact” which prevented the Court’s grant of the motion. The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that decision, finding that Scott’s action could constitute “deadly force” and that a reasonable jury might find that his use of force was not appropriate.",,,,"ARREST",3
,,"Is the use of a PIT maneuver, a seizure under the 4th Amendment, reasonable",,,,,"Yes.","The Court stated, “all that matters is whether Scott’s actions were reasonable.” Scott defended his actions by “pointing to the paramount governmental interest in ensuring public safety, and [Harris] nowhere suggests this was not the purpose motivating Scott’s behavior.” To decide upon reasonableness, the Court “must consider the risk of bodily harm that Scott’s actions posed to [Harris] in light of the threat to the public that Scott was trying to eliminate.” The Court found it “clear from the videotape that [Harris] posed an actual and imminent threat to the lives of any pedestrians who might have been present, to other civilian motorists, and to the officers involved in the chase.” The Court found it “equally clear that Scott’s actions posed a high likelihood of serious physical injury or death to [Harris] – though not the near certainty of death posed by” a shooting such as occurred in Garner. It was Harris, “after all, who intentionally placed himself and the public in danger by unlawfully engaging in the reckless, high-speed flight that ultimately produced the choice between two evils that Scott confronted.”","ARREST",3
