Officer Williamson concluded that neither Torres nor her companion was the target\\\nof the warrant. When the officers approached the vehicle, the companion fled, and Torres got\\\ninto the driver’s seat of the vehicle. The officers, wearing tactical vests marked with police\\\nidentification, attempted to speak with Torres. Torres failed to notice the officers until one\\\nofficer attempted to open the vehicle’s door.\\\nTorres, who was experiencing methamphetamine withdrawal symptoms, believe that the officers\\\nwere armed carjackers trying to steal her car. Acting upon her believe that she was being\\\ncarjacked, Torres hit the gas pedal to escape. Officers Madrid and Williamson stood in the path\\\nof the vehicle, drew their service pistols, and fired 13 shots at Torres, striking her twice in the\\\nback and temporarily paralyzing her left arm. Using only her right hand, Torres drove out of the\\\ncomplex’s parking lot and stopped in another parking lot. After asking a bystander to report an\\\nattempted carjacking, Torres stole a Kia Soul that happened to be idling nearby and drove 75\\\nmiles to Grants, New Mexico. Torres sought treatment at a hospital in Grants but was airlifted to\\\na hospital in Albuquerque for appropriate care. Police arrested Torres and she pleaded no\\\ncontest to aggravated fleeing from a law enforcement officer, assault on a peace officer, and\\\nunlawfully taking a motor vehicle.\\\nTorres filed a lawsuit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §1983 claiming that Officers Madrid and Williamson\\\napplied excessive force, making the shooting an unreasonable seizure under the Fourth\\\n31\\\n\\\n\fAmendment. The district court granted summary judgment to the officers. The Tenth Circuit\\\naffirmed on the ground that “a suspect’s continued flight after being shot by police negates a\\\nFourth Amendment excessive-force claim.” Under Tenth Circuit precedent, “no seizure can occur\\\nunless there is physical touch or a show of authority,” and that “such physical touch (or force)\\\nmust terminate the suspect’s movement” or otherwise give rise to physical control over the\\\nsuspect.\\\nISSUE:",

    "discussion": "Coolidge’s first claim was that the warrant was invalid because it was “not issued\nby a ‘neutral and detached magistrate.’” The “determination of probable cause was made by the\nchief ‘government enforcement agent’ of the State – the Attorney General – who was actively in\ncharge of the investigation and later was to be chief prosecutor at the trial.” The State argued\nthat “any magistrate, confronted with the showing of probable cause made by the … police chief,\nwould have issued the warrant in question.” The Court noted that “prosecutors and policemen\nsimply cannot be asked to maintain the requisite neutrality with regard to their own\ninvestigations.” The Court found that the warrant could not stand.\nTo save the conviction, the State next proposed “three distinct theories to bring the facts of the\ncase within one or another of the exceptions to the warrant requirement.” First, the state\nsuggested that the search of the vehicle was incident to a valid arrest. However, even assuming\nthat Coolidge’s arrest, inside his home was valid, the search of a vehicle outside, in the driveway,\nwas certainly outside his control. (And in fact, the “vehicle was not touched until Coolidge had\nbeen removed from the scene.”) Controlling case law at the time “make it clear beyond any\nquestion that a lawful pre-Chimel arrest of a suspect outside his house could never by itself\njustify a warrantless search inside the house.” There was nothing that would suggest that “a\ndifferent result” would be the case under the reverse. Even assuming that a search of the vehicle\nin the driveway was permitted, Preston v. U.S.87 made it “plain that they could not legally seize\nthe car, remove it, and search it at their leisure without a warrant.”\nNext, the State proposed that a Carroll search was appropriate. The Court, however, noted that\nthere was “no suggestion that, on the night in question, the car was being used for any illegal\npurpose, and it was regularly parked in the driveway of the house.” The objects believed to be in\nthe vehicle “were neither stolen nor contraband nor dangerous.” There was no way Coolidge\ncould have “gained access to the automobile after the police arrived on his property.” The Court\nagreed that there was probable cause but found no exigency to justify a search.88\nThird, the state put forth that the vehicle itself was an “instrumentality of the crime” and could\nbe seized because it was in plain view.

    "full_text": "DISCUSSION: Coolidge’s first claim was that the warrant was invalid because it was “not issued\\\nby a ‘neutral and detached magistrate.’” The “determination of probable cause was made by the\\\nchief ‘government enforcement agent’ of the State – the Attorney General – who was actively in\\\ncharge of the investigation and later was to be chief prosecutor at the trial.” The State argued\\\nthat “any magistrate, confronted with the showing of probable cause made by the … police chief,\\\nwould have issued the warrant in question.” The Court noted that “prosecutors and policemen\\\nsimply cannot be asked to maintain the requisite neutrality with regard to their own\\\ninvestigations.” The Court found that the warrant could not stand.\\\nTo save the conviction, the State next proposed “three distinct theories to bring the facts of the\\\ncase within one or another of the exceptions to the warrant requirement.” First, the state\\\nsuggested that the search of the vehicle was incident to a valid arrest. However, even assuming\\\nthat Coolidge’s arrest, inside his home was valid, the search of a vehicle outside, in the driveway,\\\nwas certainly outside his control. (And in fact, the “vehicle was not touched until Coolidge had\\\nbeen removed from the scene.”) Controlling case law at the time “make it clear beyond any\\\nquestion that a lawful pre-Chimel arrest of a suspect outside his house could never by itself\\\njustify a warrantless search inside the house.” There was nothing that would suggest that “a\\\ndifferent result” would be the case under the reverse. Even assuming that a search of the vehicle\\\nin the driveway was permitted, Preston v. U.S.87 made it “plain that they could not legally seize\\\nthe car, remove it, and search it at their leisure without a warrant.”\\\nNext, the State proposed that a Carroll search was appropriate. The Court, however, noted that\\\nthere was “no suggestion that, on the night in question, the car was being used for any illegal\\\npurpose, and it was regularly parked in the driveway of the house.” The objects believed to be in\\\nthe vehicle “were neither stolen nor contraband nor dangerous.” There was no way Coolidge\\\ncould have “gained access to the automobile after the police arrived on his property.” The Court\\\nagreed that there was probable cause but found no exigency to justify a search.88\\\nThird, the state put forth that the vehicle itself was an “instrumentality of the crime” and could\\\nbe seized because it was in plain view.

Must\\\nthey all consent? Must they all be asked? Is consent by one occupant enough? Initially, the\\\nCourt faced that issue in U.S. v. Matlock,94 holding that “the consent of one who possesses\\\ncommon authority over premises or effects is valid as against the absent, nonconsenting person\\\nwith whom that authority is shared.” In Illinois v. Rodriguez, the earlier holding was reaffirmed\\\nand extended, when the consent was given by a person who officers reasonably believed was a\\\nresident, but in fact, was not.95 Although consent by “one resident of jointly owned premises” is\\\nusually enough, the court had “recognized a narrow exception to this rule in Georgia v.\\\nRandolph.96 In that case, the Court upheld that a “physically present inhabitant’s express refusal\\\nof consent to a police search [of his home] is dispositive as to him, regardless of the consent of a\\\nfellow occupant.” However, the Randolph Court “went to great lengths to make clear that its\\\nholding was limited to situations in which the objecting occupant is present.”\\\nIn this case, Fernandez argued that the only reason he was not present was because he was\\\narrested, and that his objection should have remained in effect. However, the Court noted that\\\nthe dictum in Randolph did not mean that removing an occupant under a valid arrest would\\\nnecessarily invalidate the search. Following the rule proposed by Fernandez would require\\\nofficers to decide how long an objection should reasonably last. The Court concluded that it\\\nwould take Randolph on its face, and that denying someone in the position of Rojas “the right to\\\n55\\\n\\\n\fallow the police to enter her home would also show disrespect for her independence,” especially\\\nwhen she would have reason to have all dangerous items removed from the premises.

    "full_text": "“When a parolee has been charged with a crime and moves to suppress evidence\\\nobtained from a warrantless search pursuant to the Fourth Amendment, a court\\\nmust determine whether the search was reasonable under the totality of the\\\ncircumstances by balancing the parolee\\'s reasonable expectation of privacy\\\nagainst the necessity of the search to the promote the Commonwealth\\'s\\\nlegitimate interests.”102\\\nSo, how do we determine a parolee’s reasonable expectation of privacy? The Court states, “[a]\\\nparolee\\'s reasonable expectation of privacy should be determined by considering the nature of\\\nparole itself, the conditions of parole, the place where the search occurred, the circumstances\\\ngiving rise to the search, the manner of the search, and any other relevant information.”103 In\\\nother words, we must consider the safeguards put in place by the Commonwealth.\\\n66\\\n\\\n\fHere, the Court first looked to Gasaway’s parole agreement. His parole agreement explicitly\\\nstated he agreed to “be subject to search and seizure without a warrant if my officer has\\\nreasonable suspicion that I may have illegal drugs, alcohol or other contraband on my person or\\\nproperty.”104 Second, they looked at the Kentucky Department of Corrections’ general\\\nprocedures governing parolee searches, which expressly state, “[a]n offender shall be subject to\\\na search of his person, residence, or other property under his control. The basis of any search\\\nshall be consent, a search warrant, or reasonable suspicion that the search will produce evidence\\\nof a violation of the offender\\'s conditions of supervision.”105\\\nConsidering the foregoing, the Court concluded “the search of Gasaway\\'s truck was reasonable\\\nunder the totality of the circumstances. The Commonwealth clearly has a legitimate and\\\noverwhelming interest in the supervision of parolees. Gasaway\\'s reasonable expectation of\\\nprivacy was minimal, requiring only reasonable suspicion to justify a warrantless search on these\\\nfacts.”106 And here, the detective had a reasonable suspicion Gasaway’s truck contained\\\ncontraband.\\\nWould the search have been justified by the vehicle exception to the warrant requirement? No.\\\nWhile Gasaway’s truck was a readily mobile vehicle in a public place, the officers lacked probable\\\ncause to search the truck. There was no established nexus between what the officers knew at the\\\ntime and the truck sufficient to establish probable cause that the vehicle contained contraband\\\nor evidence of a crime. The officers here had only a reasonable suspicion.\\\nWould the search have been justified as a search incident to arrest? No. First, Gasaway was\\\nsecured and not within reaching distance of the vehicle’s contents. Second, the detective\\\ntestified he was looking for “other drugs” which may be in the vehicle, rather than evidence of\\\nthe crime for which Gasaway was arrested for—possession of heroin. Therefore, per the law set\\\nforth in Gant107, the search of the truck was not justified as a search incident to arrest.",

Six days later, Officer Davis “interviewed an informant who passed along\\\ninformation that … Hensley had driven the getaway car during the armed robbery.” Davis put out\\\na “wanted flyer” to nearby agencies, which “warned other departments to use caution and to\\\nconsider Hensley armed and dangerous.” One of the agencies that received the flyer was\\\nCovington PD, and some of the officers at that agency were familiar with Hensley. They\\\n“periodically looked for him at places in Covington he was known to frequent.”\\\nOn December 16, Covington Police Officer Eger spotted Hensley and asked by radio if he was the\\\nsubject of an outstanding arrest warrant. Two other officers came up on the radio and stated\\\nthat there “might be” an Ohio warrant. The officers, Cope and Rassache, “subsequently testified\\\nthat they had heard or read the St. Bernard flyer on several occasions, that they recalled that the\\\nflyer sought a stop for investigation only, and that in their experience the issuance of such a flyer\\\nwas usually followed by the issuance of an arrest warrant.”\\\nHowever, the “dispatcher had difficulty in confirming whether a warrant had been issued.” As\\\nthe dispatcher called seeking the warrant, Cope spotted Hensley and pulled him over. Cope drew\\\nhis weapon, approached the car, and had Hensley and his passenger step out of the car. Officer\\\nRassache arrived and recognized the passenger as a convicted felon, Green. Rassache also saw\\\nthe “butt of a revolver protruding from underneath the passenger’s seat.” Green was arrested. A\\\n83\\\n\\\n\ffurther search of the car “uncovered a second handgun wrapped in a jacket in the middle of the\\\nfront seat and a third handgun in a bag in the back seat.” Hensley was also arrested.\\\nAfter state charges were dismissed, Hensley was indicted in the federal courts for being a felon in\\\npossession of a handgun. Hensley moved to suppress the firearms “on the grounds that the\\\nCovington police had impermissibly stopped him in violation of the Fourth Amendment.” The\\\nDistrict Court, however, held the stop to be proper and Hensley was convicted. The case was\\\nappealed, and the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear the case.\\\nISSUE:",

    "full_text": "circumstance, thereby permitting law enforcement to enter a residence without a warrant?\\\nHOLDING\\\n\\\nNo.\\\n\\\nDISCUSSION The Fourth Amendment provides that “[t]he right of the people to be secure in\\\ntheir persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not\\\nbe violated.” As that text makes clear, “the ultimate touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is\\\n‘reasonableness.’”125 That standard “generally requires the obtaining of a judicial warrant”\\\nbefore a law enforcement officer can enter a home without permission.126 But not always: The\\\n“warrant requirement is subject to certain exceptions.”127\\\nExigent circumstances are one important exception. An officer may make a warrantless entry\\\nwhen “the exigencies of the situation” create a compelling law enforcement need.128 The\\\nexigent circumstances exception enables law enforcement officers to handle emergency\\\nsituations presenting a “compelling need for official action and no time to secure a warrant.”129\\\nOver the years, this Court has identified several such exigencies. An officer, for example, may\\\n“enter a home without a warrant to render emergency assistance to an injured occupant[,] to\\\nprotect an occupant from imminent injury,” or to ensure his own safety.130 So too, the police\\\nmay make a warrantless entry to “prevent the imminent destruction of evidence” or to “prevent\\\na suspect\\'s escape.”131 In those circumstances, the delay required to obtain a warrant would\\\nbring about “some real immediate and serious consequences”—and so the absence of a warrant\\\nis excused.132\\\n98\\\n\\\n\fExigent circumstances “requires a court to examine whether an emergency justified a\\\nwarrantless search in each particular case.”133 Or put more curtly, the exception is “casespecific.”134 That approach reflects the nature of emergencies. Whether a “now or never\\\nsituation” actually exists depends upon facts on the ground.135 The issue is most naturally\\\nconsidered by “look[ing] to the totality of circumstances” confronting the officer as he decides to\\\nmake a warrantless entry.136\\\nThe United States Supreme Court continued to recognize that a person’s living space has the\\\ngreatest expectation of privacy under the Fourth Amendment. The Fourth Amendment is based\\\non the principle that the “right of a man to retreat into his own home and there be free from\\\nunreasonable government intrusion.”137 The Fourth Amendment thus “draw[s] a firm line at the\\\nentrance to the house.”138 What lies behind that line is of course not inviolable. An officer may\\\nalways enter a home with a proper warrant. Exigent circumstances allow even warrantless\\\nintrusions.139 But the contours of that or any other warrant exception permitting home entry are\\\n“jealously and carefully drawn,” in keeping with the “centuries-old principle” that the “home is\\\nentitled to special protection.”140\\\nThe Supreme Court held that misdemeanors are usually minor offenses, categorized by less\\\nviolent and less dangerous crimes. When a minor offense alone is involved, law enforcement\\\ndoes not usually face the kind of emergency that can justify a warrantless home entry. While\\\nflight could potentially necessitate quick action by police, the Supreme Court determined that\\\nevery case of misdemeanor flight does not pose immediate dangers of evidence destruction or\\\nfurther flight.\\\nAccordingly, the Fourth Amendment requires an assessment of the case-by-case exigences\\\narising from a misdemeanant’s flight. That approach will in many, if not most, cases allow a\\\nwarrantless home entry. When the totality of circumstances shows an emergency—such as\\\nimminent harm to others, a threat to the officer himself, destruction of evidence, or escape from\\\nthe home—the police may act without waiting. And those circumstances, as described just\\\nabove, include the flight itself. But the need to pursue a misdemeanant does not trigger a\\\ncategorical rule allowing home entry, even absent a law enforcement emergency. Accordingly,\\\nthe Supreme Court held that when nature of the crime, the nature of the flight, and surrounding\\\nfacts present no such exigency, officers must respect the sanctity of the home—which means the\\\nofficers must get a warrant.\\\nThe United States Supreme Court vacated the judgment of the California Court of Appeals.",

Traffic\nroadblocks intended to catch offenders who are an “immediate, vehicle-bound threat to life and\nlimb,” such as sobriety checkpoints, remain permissible, as they bear a “close connection to\nroadway safety.” Roadblocks have been, and still are, effective tools for determining if a person\nis licensed and a vehicle registered. The Court specifically held that a DUI roadblock is also\n109\n\n\fimportant to highway safety and thus reasonable under the Fourth Amendment. In addition, the\nCourt also noted that this does not prevent law enforcement authorities setting up an\nemergency roadblock to catch a fleeing criminal or to thwart imminent danger such as a terrorist\nattack.\nThe Court also said that this decision does not prevent law enforcement officers, while\nconducting a lawful roadblock, from arresting a motorist for a crime unrelated to the reason for\nthe roadblock. For example, while conducting a roadblock to check license and registration, if the\nofficer smelled marijuana, the officer would then have appropriate cause to check the vehicle for\nfurther evidence of marijuana possession.",

An appellate court agreed and found the stop to be\\\nunreasonable. The case was appealed, and the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear the case.\\\nISSUE:\\\nDo roadblocks set up expressly for the purpose of narcotics interdiction violate the\\\nreasonableness of seizures under the Fourth Amendment?\\\nHOLDING:\\\n\\\nYes.\\\n\\\nDISCUSSION: The Court declined to allow a roadblock that has, as its primary purpose, the\\\nuncovering of evidence of general criminal wrongdoing (in this case, narcotics interdiction). To\\\nallow such actions would remove the requirement of individualized suspicion in detaining\\\npersons. Checkpoints have previously only been recognized as limited exceptions to the general\\\nrule of no detention without that particularized reasonable suspicion necessary. Traffic\\\nroadblocks intended to catch offenders who are an “immediate, vehicle-bound threat to life and\\\nlimb,” such as sobriety checkpoints, remain permissible, as they bear a “close connection to\\\nroadway safety.” Roadblocks have been, and still are, effective tools for determining if a person\\\nis licensed and a vehicle registered. The Court specifically held that a DUI roadblock is also\\\n109\\\n\\\n\fimportant to highway safety and thus reasonable under the Fourth Amendment. In addition, the\\\nCourt also noted that this does not prevent law enforcement authorities setting up an\\\nemergency roadblock to catch a fleeing criminal or to thwart imminent danger such as a terrorist\\\nattack.\\\nThe Court also said that this decision does not prevent law enforcement officers, while\\\nconducting a lawful roadblock, from arresting a motorist for a crime unrelated to the reason for\\\nthe roadblock. For example, while conducting a roadblock to check license and registration, if the\\\nofficer smelled marijuana, the officer would then have appropriate cause to check the vehicle for\\\nfurther evidence of marijuana possession.",
