Daughtery “informed Overdahl and\\\nChrisman of their” Miranda rights, and each “acknowledged that he understood his rights and\\\nindicated that he was willing to waive them.” Daughtery asked about other contraband in the\\\nroom, and Chrisman handed him the box he’d had in his hands when Daughtery arrived. It\\\n“contained three small plastic bags filled with marihuana and $112 in cash.” When a second\\\nofficer arrived in response to a call from Overdahl, they told the students that a room search\\\nwould be necessary. They told the two students that “they had an absolute right to insist that the\\\nofficers first obtain a search warrant, but that they could voluntarily consent to the search.” The\\\n“two students conferred in whispers for several minutes before announcing their consent” and\\\nthey also signed written waivers. “The search yielded more marihuana and a quantity of lysergic\\\nacid diethylamide (LSD).”\\\nChrisman was charged with possession of both drugs, and he moved for suppression of the\\\nevidence.

The Fourth\\\nAmendment protects the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and\\\neffects, against unreasonable searches and seizures. Supreme Court precedent has interpreted\\\nthe term “seizure” by consulting the common law of arrest. The arrest of a person is a seizure.\\\nThe common law considered the application of physical force of the body of a person with the\\\nintent to restrain to be an arrest even if the person does not yield.\\\nThe appropriate inquiry is whether the challenged conduct by law enforcement manifests an\\\nintent to restrain. This test does not depend on either the subjective motivation of the officer or\\\nthe subjective perception of the suspect. The type of force used also does not impact this test. A\\\nseizure requires the use of force with intent to restrain, as opposed to force applied by accident\\\nor for some other purpose. A seizure by force lasts only as long as the application of force unless\\\nthe suspect submits.\\\nIn this case, the officers applied physical force to Torres’ body by shooting her and objectively\\\nmanifested an intent to restrain her from driving away. The Supreme Court held that the officers\\\nseized Torres for the instant that the bullets struck her. Determining whether a seizure exists is\\\nonly the first step in the analysis. The Fourth Amendment does not forbid all seizures – just\\\nunreasonable seizures.\\\nThe Supreme Court was only asked to determine whether Torres was seized. The Supreme Court\\\ndid not consider whether the seizure was reasonable, damages caused by the seizure, or whether\\\nthe officers were entitled to qualified immunity. Those questions will be determined on remand.",

Going around to a back door may or may not be\\\npermissible, depending on the location that a member of the public would normally access that\\\nresidence. For that reason, each case should be analyzed on its own merits and facts specific to\\\nthe location of the knock-and-talk. Factors to be considered are the curtilage question, as well as\\\nthe way the officer asks for consent or interacts with the resident. The curtilage issue must be\\\naddressed utilizing the factors from U.S. v. Dunn.86\\\n36\\\n\\\n\fIn Quintana, the knock-and-talk by the police was not within the parameters of the Fourth\\\nAmendment because the officer went beyond the public entrance of the home when he entered\\\nthe backyard. He stood under the air conditioner in order to smell the odor of marijuana. Per\\\nthe Dunn factors, the area under the air conditioner is extremely close to the home, within the\\\nhome’s fenced-in area, and was at the back of the house, private from public access. This was a\\\nviolation of Quintana’s Fourth Amendment rights.\\\nIn Bottoms, the knock-and-talk took place at the front door of the residence. The officers\\\nconducted a thorough investigation before approaching the home. Once at the home, the\\\nofficers properly requested consent to search, which was denied. They used their observations\\\nof Melissa, in addition to the facts of their investigation, and did not go beyond the area that\\\ncould be accessed by the public.

    "title": "No (but see discussion).",
    "content": "DISCUSSION: Coolidge’s first claim was that the warrant was invalid because it was “not issued\\\nby a ‘neutral and detached magistrate.’” The “determination of probable cause was made by the\\\nchief ‘government enforcement agent’ of the State – the Attorney General – who was actively in\\\ncharge of the investigation and later was to be chief prosecutor at the trial.” The State argued\\\nthat “any magistrate, confronted with the showing of probable cause made by the … police chief,\\\nwould have issued the warrant in question.” The Court noted that “prosecutors and policemen\\\nsimply cannot be asked to maintain the requisite neutrality with regard to their own\\\ninvestigations.” The Court found that the warrant could not stand.\\\nTo save the conviction, the State next proposed “three distinct theories to bring the facts of the\\\ncase within one or another of the exceptions to the warrant requirement.” First, the state\\\nsuggested that the search of the vehicle was incident to a valid arrest. However, even assuming\\\nthat Coolidge’s arrest, inside his home was valid, the search of a vehicle outside, in the driveway,\\\nwas certainly outside his control. (And in fact, the “vehicle was not touched until Coolidge had\\\nbeen removed from the scene.”) Controlling case law at the time “make it clear beyond any\\\nquestion that a lawful pre-Chimel arrest of a suspect outside his house could never by itself\\\njustify a warrantless search inside the house.” There was nothing that would suggest that “a\\\ndifferent result” would be the case under the reverse. Even assuming that a search of the vehicle\\\nin the driveway was permitted, Preston v. U.S.87 made it “plain that they could not legally seize\\\nthe car, remove it, and search it at their leisure without a warrant.”\\\nNext, the State proposed that a Carroll search was appropriate. The Court, however, noted that\\\nthere was “no suggestion that, on the night in question, the car was being used for any illegal\\\npurpose, and it was regularly parked in the driveway of the house.” The objects believed to be in\\\nthe vehicle “were neither stolen nor contraband nor dangerous.” There was no way Coolidge\\\ncould have “gained access to the automobile after the police arrived on his property.” The Court\\\nagreed that there was probable cause but found no exigency to justify a search.88\\\nThird, the state put forth that the vehicle itself was an “instrumentality of the crime” and could\\\nbe seized because it was in plain view. The Court, however, noted that if “the initial intrusion that\\\nbrings the police within plain view … is supported,” either by a warrant or “by one of the\\\nrecognized exceptions to the warrant requirement,” the seizure will be appropriate. In addition,\\\nthe nature of the item must be “immediately apparent.” The Court noted that “plain view alone\\\nis never enough to justify the warrantless seizure of evidence.” Even with “[i]ncontrovertible\\\n38\\\n\\\n\ftestimony of the senses that an incriminating object is on premises belonging to a criminal\\\nsuspect may establish the fullest possible measure of probable cause,” it has still “repeatedly\\\nstated and enforced the basic rule that the police may not enter and make a warrantless\\\nseizure.” In addition, plain view must be inadvertent, and “where the discovery is anticipated,\\\nwhere the police know in advance the location of the evidence and intend to seize it, the\\\nsituation is entirely different.”\\\nIn this case, the Court found that the “’plain view’ exception cannot justify the police seizure of\\\nthe Pontiac car in this case,” as “[t]hey had ample opportunity to obtain a valid warrant; they\\\nknew the automobile’s exact description and location well in advance; they intended to seize it\\\nwhen they came upon Coolidge’s property.”",

Brown rummaged in the glovebox for his operator’s\\\nlicense. Knowing from experience that narcotics were often packaged in that way, the “officer\\\nshifted his position to obtain a better view” and “noticed small plastic vials, loose white powder,\\\nand an open bag of party balloons in the glove compartment.” The officer also used his flashlight\\\nto illuminate the area. His search being fruitless, Brown admitted to the officer that he was not in\\\npossession of his driver’s license.

The trial court denied the motion and Brown\\\nwas convicted.

New Hampshire.90 The Court explained that once an object has been observed in\\\n“plain view,” “the owner’s remaining interests in the object are merely those of possession and\\\nownership.” The Court’s decisions have “come to reflect the rule that if, while lawfully engaged\\\nin an activity in a particular place, police officers perceive a suspicious object, they may seize it\\\nimmediately.”\\\nThe Court also ruled that it was “beyond dispute that [the officer’s] action in shining his flashlight\\\nto illuminate the interior of Brown’s car trenched upon no right secured to the latter by the\\\n39\\\n\\\n\fFourth Amendment.” In a much earlier case, U.S. v. Lee,91 the Court had ruled that the use of a\\\nsearchlight to illuminate an area did not constitute a search. In addition, the fact that the officer\\\n“changed his position” and “bent down” to view the contents of the glove compartment – in fact,\\\nany member of the general public could have done the same. “There is no legitimate expectation\\\nof privacy … shielding that portion of the interior of an automobile which may be viewed from\\\noutside the vehicle by inquisitive passerby or diligent police officers.” As such, there was no\\\ndoubt that the first prong of the “plain view” analysis was met – in that the officer was where he\\\nwas lawfully allowed to be when he observed the contraband.\\\nNext, the Court discussed whether the “incriminating nature of the items [were] ‘immediately\\\napparent’ to the police officer.” The Texas appellate court interpreted this to mean that the\\\nofficer “must be possessed of near certainty as to the seizable nature of the items.” The Court\\\nacknowledged that its use of the phrase “immediately apparent” “was very likely an unhappy\\\nchoice of words, since it can be taken to imply that an unduly high degree of certainty as to the\\\nincriminatory character of evidence is necessary for an application of the ‘plain view’ doctrine,”\\\nInstead, the Court looked to its opinion in Colorado v. Bannister,92 and held, specifically, that the\\\nappropriate standard for the second prong of the plain view analysis is probable cause. In\\\naddition, the Court found that the Texas officer did possess sufficient probable cause as to justify\\\nhis seizure of the green balloon.",

The devices led\\\nthem to Dunn’s ranch. Aerial photographs showed the truck backed up to a barn behind the\\\nhouse. A perimeter fence surrounded the ranch and inside that area, several barbed wire fences\\\n45\\\n\\\n\fwere erected. In particular, one was around the house area, which was 150 feet (50 yards) from\\\nthe barn, and a wooden fence enclosed the front area of the barn. The barn itself had an open\\\ndoorway surrounded by locked, waist-high gates.\\\nThe officers entered the fenced-in area and went to the front of the barn. They smelled\\\nchemicals and heard a motor running. The agents did not cross the locked gate, but using a\\\nflashlight, peered inside, and saw what they believed to be a drug lab. Twice the next day, they\\\nentered the ranch, confirming the presence of the lab, but did not enter the barn itself.

Common\\\nauthority is not synonymous with technical property interest, but that any of the cohabitants has\\\na right to permit inspection of common areas.

Also, while you may share authority over\\\ncommon areas, they would not likely have authority to let officers search your personal things,\\\nlike your dresser drawers. The Court invoked Minnesota v.

The dispute effectively negatives the consent.\\\nThe Court said that so long as there was no evidence that the police have removed the\\\npotentially objecting party for the sake of pre-empting his opportunity to object, the consent of\\\nthe other co-tenant would be valid.",

Rodriguez, the earlier holding was reaffirmed\\\nand extended, when the consent was given by a person who officers reasonably believed was a\\\nresident, but in fact, was not.95 Although consent by “one resident of jointly owned premises” is\\\nusually enough, the court had “recognized a narrow exception to this rule in Georgia v.\\\nRandolph.96 In that case, the Court upheld that a “physically present inhabitant’s express refusal\\\nof consent to a police search [of his home] is dispositive as to him, regardless of the consent of a\\\nfellow occupant.” However, the Randolph Court “went to great lengths to make clear that its\\\nholding was limited to situations in which the objecting occupant is present.”\\\nIn this case, Fernandez argued that the only reason he was not present was because he was\\\narrested, and that his objection should have remained in effect.

In this situation, the Court noted that the “pen register was installed on\\\ntelephone company property at the telephone company’s central offices.” The Court\\\ndifferentiated the pen register from the recording device used in Katz, in that “pen registers do\\\nnot acquire the contents of communications” – but simply record the numbers dialed.

First, “the Fourth Amendment does not prohibit a police officer from conducting a\\\nsuspicionless search of a parolee.”101 Explaining that because parole is akin to incarceration and\\\nthe need for supervision of parolees is great, a police officer may search a parolee without any\\\nsuspicion of criminal activity. However, the Court also held that—second—a state itself may\\\ninstitute its own safeguards to prevent abusive and harassing searches.\\\nYears later, in Bratcher v. Commonwealth, 424 S.W. 3d 411 (Ky. 2014), the Kentucky Supreme\\\nCourt applied the holding of Samson incorrectly. In Bratcher, the Kentucky Supreme Court\\\ncorrectly held that the Fourth Amendment did not prohibit police officers from conducting\\\nwarrantless and suspicionless search of parolees. However, they incorrectly held that the\\\nCommonwealth could not institute its own safeguards to prevent abusive and harassing\\\nsearches.",

The Court states, “[a]\\\nparolee\\'s reasonable expectation of privacy should be determined by considering the nature of\\\nparole itself, the conditions of parole, the place where the search occurred, the circumstances\\\ngiving rise to the search, the manner of the search, and any other relevant information.”103 In\\\nother words, we must consider the safeguards put in place by the Commonwealth.\\\n66\\\n\\\n\fHere, the Court first looked to Gasaway’s parole agreement. His parole agreement explicitly\\\nstated he agreed to “be subject to search and seizure without a warrant if my officer has\\\nreasonable suspicion that I may have illegal drugs, alcohol or other contraband on my person or\\\nproperty.”104 Second, they looked at the Kentucky Department of Corrections’ general\\\nprocedures governing parolee searches, which expressly state, “[a]n offender shall be subject to\\\na search of his person, residence, or other property under his control. The basis of any search\\\nshall be consent, a search warrant, or reasonable suspicion that the search will produce evidence\\\nof a violation of the offender\\'s conditions of supervision.”105\\\nConsidering the foregoing, the Court concluded “the search of Gasaway\\'s truck was reasonable\\\nunder the totality of the circumstances. The Commonwealth clearly has a legitimate and\\\noverwhelming interest in the supervision of parolees. Gasaway\\'s reasonable expectation of\\\nprivacy was minimal, requiring only reasonable suspicion to justify a warrantless search on these\\\nfacts.”106 And here, the detective had a reasonable suspicion Gasaway’s truck contained\\\ncontraband.\\\nWould the search have been justified by the vehicle exception to the warrant requirement? No.\\\nWhile Gasaway’s truck was a readily mobile vehicle in a public place, the officers lacked probable\\\ncause to search the truck. There was no established nexus between what the officers knew at the\\\ntime and the truck sufficient to establish probable cause that the vehicle contained contraband\\\nor evidence of a crime. The officers here had only a reasonable suspicion.\\\nWould the search have been justified as a search incident to arrest? No. First, Gasaway was\\\nsecured and not within reaching distance of the vehicle’s contents. Second, the detective\\\ntestified he was looking for “other drugs” which may be in the vehicle, rather than evidence of\\\nthe crime for which Gasaway was arrested for—possession of heroin. Therefore, per the law set\\\nforth in Gant107, the search of the truck was not justified as a search incident to arrest.",

    "content": "HOLDING:\\\n\\\nYes.\\\n\\\nDISCUSSION: To begin, the Court recognized there is no bright-line rule about how invasive a\\\nwarrantless search may be. However, a valid arrest does not mean that an arrestee is subject to\\\nany and all searches an arresting officer wishes to conduct. It depends on the circumstances.\\\nTherefore, even a search supported by probable cause maybe be unconstitutional if it is\\\nconducted in an unreasonable manner. Strip-searches are inherently invasive and embarrassing,\\\nso it is of great importance that they be conducted reasonably.\\\nTo determine whether a strip search is reasonable, the court will consider four factors. The\\\nsecond factor is further broken down into four parts:115\\\n(1) the scope of the particular intrusion,\\\n(2) the manner in which the search is conducted:\\\na. the type of search and its commonality,\\\nb. who performed the search,\\\nc. the weighted risk, pain, and trauma to the arrestee, and\\\nd. the skills required to conduct the search.\\\n(3) the justification for initiating the search, and\\\n(4) the place in which it is conducted.\\\nConsidering these factors, the Court concluded the strip search was reasonable. First, the scope\\\nof the intrusion was merely a visual inspection. Second, strip searches are a commonly\\\nperformed search by law enforcement officers. And while it was embarrassing for Marshall, it\\\nwas conducted within four walls, out of sight of any other persons, and no one physically\\\ntouched any sensitive anatomy. Any pain, trauma, or risk was minimal. Further, there is not\\\nspecialized training required to conduct a strip search. It requires only common sense and\\\ndecency which was displayed here by the officers. Third, this search was supported by probable\\\ncause. Fourth, the search was conducted within four walls, and Marshall was not exposed to\\\nanyone not involved in the search.\\\nTherefore, based on the totality of the circumstances, the strip search was reasonable.\\\n\\\n86\\\n\\\n\fAnonymous Tips",

On that date, he traveled to West Bend,\\\nWisconsin, and during the evening hours, he was seen at two small taverns in the area.\\\nSometime the morning of the 10th, his vehicle broke down and was towed to his brother’s farm,\\\nin an adjacent county. He returned to Chicago, rented another vehicle, and drove back to\\\nWisconsin. That rented vehicle was seen on the farm in the early morning of the 11th, and later\\\n94\\\n\\\n\fthat morning, Dombrowski purchased two towels at a nearby store. During that evening,\\\nDombrowski was seen drinking heavily and had a wreck. He was picked up by a passing motorist\\\nand taken into Kewaskum, where two local officers picked him up to take him back to the wreck\\\nscene. They noticed he appeared to be drunk and gave conflicting information about the wreck.\\\nAt the scene, they investigated the wreck. Believing Chicago officers were required to carry their\\\nweapons at all times, they searched Dombrowski and found no weapon. While waiting for a towtruck, they searched the passenger area and glovebox of the rented vehicle, again finding no\\\nweapon. The vehicle was towed to a private garage, where it would be left outside. Dombrowski\\\nwas taken to the West Bend police station and arrested for drunken driving. Because of his\\\ninjuries from the wreck, he was then taken to the hospital. The officers stated he was impaired\\\nand “incoherent at times.” While at the hospital, he fell into a coma and was hospitalized, under\\\nguard. Another officer, Weiss, went back to the garage and again searched the rented vehicle,\\\nstill believing there might be a weapon in the vehicle.\\\nInside the vehicle, Officer Weiss found a book of Chicago police regulations and a flashlight that\\\nhad drops of what appeared to be blood on it. Opening the truck, he found numerous items\\\ncovered in type O blood; Dombrowski had type A. These items included clothing, including police\\\nuniform trousers, a nightstick with “Dombrowski” stamped on it, a raincoat, a towel, and a car\\\nmat. The blood on the mat was still moist. These items were collected as evidence. Eventually\\\nDombrowski informed the police that “he believed there was a body lying near the family picnic\\\narea at the north end of his brother’s farm.” They located the body of McKinney, and he was\\\nlater found to have been struck over the head and shot, dying in the early morning hours of the\\\n11th.

The vehicle was to be left outside in an unguarded location. At the time of the\\\nsearch, the officer had no idea that a murder, or any other crime, had been committed.

    "title": "Does the pursuit of a fleeing misdemeanor suspect always qualify as an exigent",
    "content": "circumstance, thereby permitting law enforcement to enter a residence without a warrant?\\\nHOLDING\\\n\\\nNo.\\\n\\\nDISCUSSION The Fourth Amendment provides that “[t]he right of the people to be secure in\\\ntheir persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not\\\nbe violated.” As that text makes clear, “the ultimate touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is\\\n‘reasonableness.’”125 That standard “generally requires the obtaining of a judicial warrant”\\\nbefore a law enforcement officer can enter a home without permission.126 But not always: The\\\n“warrant requirement is subject to certain exceptions.”127\\\nExigent circumstances are one important exception. An officer may make a warrantless entry\\\nwhen “the exigencies of the situation” create a compelling law enforcement need.128 The\\\nexigent circumstances exception enables law enforcement officers to handle emergency\\\nsituations presenting a “compelling need for official action and no time to secure a warrant.”129\\\nOver the years, this Court has identified several such exigencies. An officer, for example, may\\\n“enter a home without a warrant to render emergency assistance to an injured occupant[,] to\\\nprotect an occupant from imminent injury,” or to ensure his own safety.130 So too, the police\\\nmay make a warrantless entry to “prevent the imminent destruction of evidence” or to “prevent\\\na suspect\\'s escape.”131 In those circumstances, the delay required to obtain a warrant would\\\nbring about “some real immediate and serious consequences”—and so the absence of a warrant\\\nis excused.132\\\n98\\\n\\\n\fExigent circumstances “requires a court to examine whether an emergency justified a\\\nwarrantless search in each particular case.”133 Or put more curtly, the exception is “casespecific.”134 That approach reflects the nature of emergencies. Whether a “now or never\\\nsituation” actually exists depends upon facts on the ground.135 The issue is most naturally\\\nconsidered by “look[ing] to the totality of circumstances” confronting the officer as he decides to\\\nmake a warrantless entry.136\\\nThe United States Supreme Court continued to recognize that a person’s living space has the\\\ngreatest expectation of privacy under the Fourth Amendment. The Fourth Amendment is based\\\non the principle that the “right of a man to retreat into his own home and there be free from\\\nunreasonable government intrusion.”137 The Fourth Amendment thus “draw[s] a firm line at the\\\nentrance to the house.”138 What lies behind that line is of course not inviolable. An officer may\\\nalways enter a home with a proper warrant. Exigent circumstances allow even warrantless\\\nintrusions.139 But the contours of that or any other warrant exception permitting home entry are\\\n“jealously and carefully drawn,” in keeping with the “centuries-old principle” that the “home is\\\nentitled to special protection.”140\\\nThe Supreme Court held that misdemeanors are usually minor offenses, categorized by less\\\nviolent and less dangerous crimes. When a minor offense alone is involved, law enforcement\\\ndoes not usually face the kind of emergency that can justify a warrantless home entry. While\\\nflight could potentially necessitate quick action by police, the Supreme Court determined that\\\nevery case of misdemeanor flight does not pose immediate dangers of evidence destruction or\\\nfurther flight.\\\nAccordingly, the Fourth Amendment requires an assessment of the case-by-case exigences\\\narising from a misdemeanant’s flight. That approach will in many, if not most, cases allow a\\\nwarrantless home entry. When the totality of circumstances shows an emergency—such as\\\nimminent harm to others, a threat to the officer himself, destruction of evidence, or escape from\\\nthe home—the police may act without waiting. And those circumstances, as described just\\\nabove, include the flight itself. But the need to pursue a misdemeanant does not trigger a\\\ncategorical rule allowing home entry, even absent a law enforcement emergency. Accordingly,\\\nthe Supreme Court held that when nature of the crime, the nature of the flight, and surrounding\\\nfacts present no such exigency, officers must respect the sanctity of the home—which means the\\\nofficers must get a warrant.\\\nThe United States Supreme Court vacated the judgment of the California Court of Appeals.",

The case was appealed, and the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear the\\\ncase.\\\n\\\n101\\\n\\\n\fISSUE:\\\nMay a traffic stop be prolonged, absent at least reasonable suspicion, to allow for\\\na drug sniff by a K-9?\\\nHOLDING:\\\n\\\nNo.\\\n\\\nDISCUSSION: The Court agreed that a “seizure for a traffic violation justifies a police\\\ninvestigation of that violation,” and is more akin to a Terry stop than an arrest. “Like a Terry\\\nstop, the tolerable duration of police inquiries in the traffic-stop context is determined by the\\\nseizure’s “mission”—to address the traffic violation that warranted the stop.”141 “Authority for\\\nthe seizure thus ends when tasks tied to the traffic infraction are—or reasonably should have\\\nbeen—completed.” In both Caballes and Johnson, the Court emphasized that an unrelated\\\ninvestigation can be done, so long as it “did not lengthen the roadside detention.”142 Additional\\\ninquiries might include “checking the driver’s license, determining whether there are outstanding\\\nwarrants against the driver, and inspecting the automobile’s registration and proof of\\\ninsurance.”143 The Court noted, however, that a “dog sniff, by contrast, is a measure aimed at\\\n‘detect[ing] evidence of ordinary criminal wrongdoing.’”144 The Court noted that the critical\\\nquestion is “not whether the dog sniff occurs before or after the officer issues a ticket … but\\\nwhether conducting the sniff ‘prolongs’ … ‘the stop.’”\\\nThe United States Supreme Court vacated the Eighth Circuit’s decision and remanded for further\\\nproceedings.",

    "content": "reasonable for an officer to suspect that the registered owner of a vehicle is the one driving the\\\nvehicle absent any information to the contrary?\\\nHOLDING:\\\n\\\nYes.\\\n\\\nDISCUSSION: The ultimate touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is reasonableness.145 The\\\nFourth Amendment permits an officer to initiate a brief investigative stop when the officer has “a\\\n102\\\n\\\n\fparticularized and objective basis for suspecting the particular person stopped of criminal\\\nactivity”146 that is considerably less than probable cause.147 Reasonable suspicion does not have\\\nto be perfect.148 In articulating reasonable suspicion, officers are also permitted to make\\\n“commonsense judgments and inferences about human behavior.”149\\\nStates have a vital interest in ensuring that only those qualified to do so are permitted to operate\\\nmotor vehicles and that licensing, registration and vehicle inspection requirements are being\\\nobserved. 150 Further, research has proven that drivers with revoked licenses frequently\\\ncontinue to drive and therefore pose safety risks to other motorists and pedestrians.\\\nIn this case, Deputy Mehrer observed a male suspect operate a 1995 Chevrolet 1500 pickup truck\\\nwith Kansas plate 295ATJ. The deputy learned from running this license plate that the truck’s\\\nregistered owner, Glover, had a revoked license. From these facts, Deputy Mehrer drew the\\\ncommonsense inference that Glover was likely the driver of the vehicle, which provided more\\\nthan reasonable suspicion to initiate the stop. Combining database information and\\\ncommonsense judgments in this context is fully consonant with Fourth Amendment precedent.\\\nThe United States Supreme Court did stress that all seizures must be justified at its inception,\\\ntaking the totality of the circumstances into account. Accordingly, the presence of additional\\\nfacts may dispel reasonable suspicion. For example, if the registered owner of the vehicle is\\\nidentified as a male in his mid-sixties, but the officer observed that the driver is a female in her\\\nmid-twenties, the totality of the circumstances would not justify a stop absent some other\\\nviolation of the law.",

Trooper Long, who made the stop, later indicated he was\\\nsuspicious of the way Byrd was driving. Byrd was visibly nervous and was found not to be an\\\nauthorized driver of the rental car he was operating. Later investigation indicated that another\\\nindividual had served as, in effect, a straw renter, and have given the keys to Byrd as soon as it\\\nwas rented. During the investigation, the troopers discovered an out of state warrant, but that\\\nstate refused to extradite. Byrd admitted there was marijuana in the car.

The Court made a distinction between passengers, who may lack\\\nthat right depending upon the circumstances, and sole occupant drivers.",

Both would have the expectation of privacy that comes with the right\\\nto exclude.\\\nThe Court agreed that in Rakas, it had agreed that the “‘wrongful’ presence at the scene of a\\\nsearch would not enable a defendant to object to the legality of the search.”156 The\\\nGovernment had argued that since Byrd knew he could not lawfully rent the vehicle on his\\\nown based on his criminal record, so he may have committed a crime by using another\\\nperson to do so. However, the Government’s argument was not made at the lower courts\\\nand, as such, could not be considered for the first time on appeal.\\\nThe Court noted, also, that the Government did argue that the troopers had probable cause\\\nto believe that the vehicle contained contraband, based on Byrd’s admission of having\\\nmarijuana. The Court remanded the matter with the ruling that Byrd did have a reasonable\\\nexpectation of privacy and thus standing to contest the search.\\\nInventory",

    "content": "DIPLOMATS; ALIENS\\\n(This material is adapted from materials published by the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center,\\\nBrunswick, GA.)\\\nDiplomatic Immunity\\\nDiplomats are representatives of a recognized foreign government who are accredited by that\\\ngovernment and are accepted by our government. There are many different types or levels of\\\ndiplomats including ambassadors, consuls, charge d\\'affaires, and ministers. Each level of diplomat\\\nhas its own degree of immunity from civil and/or criminal action. In addition, this immunity may\\\nextend beyond that of diplomats themselves and may include the entire family.\\\nThose diplomats who have immunity may not be arrested or prosecuted. If an offense has been\\\ncommitted by a person who claims to have diplomatic immunity, you may detain the person long\\\nenough to confirm whether they are in fact protected by diplomatic immunity.\\\nThe possession of a diplomatic passport by an individual does not in and of itself indicate that the\\\nholder has diplomatic immunity. Verification of diplomatic immunity may be obtained through the\\\nUnited States Department of State\\'s Office of Protocol in Washington, D.C. During normal working\\\nhours the State Department may be reached at (202) 647-1664 or (202) 647-1405. After working\\\nhours and on weekends, calls should be made to the Diplomatic Security Watch Officer at (202) 6477277. Send copies of incident reports and citations to (Fax) (202) 895-3613.\\\nShould you find that you have detained diplomats who do have full immunity, you MUST release\\\nthem.\\\nAny writ or process issued against a person holding or possessing diplomatic immunity is null and\\\nvoid, without regard to whether or not the writ or process is civil or criminal in nature. In fact, any\\\nperson who knowingly obtains or executes such a writ or process may be liable for a fine and/or\\\nimprisonment. The one exception to this rule is the issuance of parking citations and similar traffic\\\nrelated offenses.\\\nThe right to operate a motor vehicle, obtain state department diplomatic tags, and utilize a driver’s\\\npermit in the host nation is not an issue of diplomatic immunity. Officers may issue citations to\\\ndiplomats but not arrest the operator if the diplomat has immunity. It is also recognized that officers\\\nmay forbid the further operation of a vehicle by an intoxicated driver, regardless of the immunity\\\ninvolved. While the operator, if immune, cannot be arrested, the public safety issue may restrict the\\\nmovement of the vehicle until a sober and licensed driver can operate the vehicle.\\\nPersons having diplomatic immunity cannot be required to appear in court as a defendant or as a\\\nwitness for any reason. In order to have them testify, it is necessary for them to volunteer or to get\\\ntheir government to waive their immunity for that purpose.\\\nIt is a Federal crime for any person to strike, wound, imprison or offer violence to the person of a\\\ndiplomatic officer and an offender is subject to fine and/or imprisonment under Federal law as well as\\\nbeing subject to possible prosecution under applicable state statutes which apply to such criminal\\\nconduct.\\\nAny and all illegal or criminal acts perpetrated by diplomats should be reported to the Department\\\nof State to take whatever action they deem to be appropriate. They may declare a diplomat to be\\\npersona non grata and have that diplomat leave the country.\\\nA foreign embassy or other diplomatic mission is considered to be foreign soil. Therefore we\\\nhave no right to enter onto that property without the permission of an official at that mission. This\\\nholds true even in circumstances where a fire has broken out in the mission itself or where people are\\\nshooting from the mission, as occurred in London several years ago.\\\n\\\n2.3.7\\\n\\\n\fSECTION 2: GENERAL PROVISIONS\\\n\\\nNotification of Embassy Upon Arrest of Aliens.\\\nAliens are all persons in the United States who are not citizens. Aliens may be here on a\\\ntemporary basis, such as those with student visas; others may have permanent status, while others\\\nare here illegally. While in this country, aliens are subject to all of our criminal laws.\\\nIf you arrest an alien, you should ask if the alien wishes you to notify the appropriate consular or\\\ndiplomatic officers of the appropriate country. If requested, you should notify them as a matter of\\\ncourtesy. Note however, that some of our treaty obligations with foreign countries require that their\\\ndiplomatic officials be notified whenever one of their nationals is arrested in our country. To\\\ndetermine such status, call the Department of State at the telephone numbers given above; and\\\nremember to fax them a copy of your report.\\\n\\\n2.3.8",
