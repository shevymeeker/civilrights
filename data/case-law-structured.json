    "discussion": "The U. S. Supreme Court held that the agent’s manipulation of the carry-on bag\nviolated the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches. The Court rejected\nthe government’s argument that by placing his bag in the passenger compartment, and thus\nexposing it to the public, Bond did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy that his bag\nwould not be physically manipulated. After all, it would not be unusual for such a bag to be\ntouched and moved by other passengers while traveling. The Court distinguished this case from\nCalifornia v. Ciraolo,77 and Florida v. Riley78 which the government had cited as justification.

    "fullText": "everyone involved – not only the officers and the magistrate but also the occupant of the\\\npremises, who would generally either be compelled or would feel a need to stay until the search\\\nwas completed.”\\\nThe Court then questioned what should be done “when there are two or more occupants? Must\\\nthey all consent? Must they all be asked? Is consent by one occupant enough? Initially, the\\\nCourt faced that issue in U.S. v. Matlock,94 holding that “the consent of one who possesses\\\ncommon authority over premises or effects is valid as against the absent, nonconsenting person\\\nwith whom that authority is shared.” In Illinois v. Rodriguez, the earlier holding was reaffirmed\\\nand extended, when the consent was given by a person who officers reasonably believed was a\\\nresident, but in fact, was not.95 Although consent by “one resident of jointly owned premises” is\\\nusually enough, the court had “recognized a narrow exception to this rule in Georgia v.\\\nRandolph.96 In that case, the Court upheld that a “physically present inhabitant’s express refusal\\\nof consent to a police search [of his home] is dispositive as to him, regardless of the consent of a\\\nfellow occupant.” However, the Randolph Court “went to great lengths to make clear that its\\\nholding was limited to situations in which the objecting occupant is present.”\\\nIn this case, Fernandez argued that the only reason he was not present was because he was\\\narrested, and that his objection should have remained in effect. However, the Court noted that\\\nthe dictum in Randolph did not mean that removing an occupant under a valid arrest would\\\nnecessarily invalidate the search. Following the rule proposed by Fernandez would require\\\nofficers to decide how long an objection should reasonably last. The Court concluded that it\\\nwould take Randolph on its face, and that denying someone in the position of Rojas “the right to\\\n55\\\n\\\n\\fallow the police to enter her home would also show disrespect for her independence,” especially\\\nwhen she would have reason to have all dangerous items removed from the premises. The\\\nCourt agreed that “the Fourth Amendment does not give [Fernandez]” the power to control",

The Court states, “[a]\\\nparolee\\'s reasonable expectation of privacy should be determined by considering the nature of\\\nparole itself, the conditions of parole, the place where the search occurred, the circumstances\\\ngiving rise to the search, the manner of the search, and any other relevant information.”103 In\\\nother words, we must consider the safeguards put in place by the Commonwealth.\\\n66\\\n\\\n\\fHere, the Court first looked to Gasaway’s parole agreement. His parole agreement explicitly\\\nstated he agreed to “be subject to search and seizure without a warrant if my officer has\\\nreasonable suspicion that I may have illegal drugs, alcohol or other contraband on my person or\\\nproperty.”104 Second, they looked at the Kentucky Department of Corrections’ general\\\nprocedures governing parolee searches, which expressly state, “[a]n offender shall be subject to\\\na search of his person, residence, or other property under his control. The basis of any search\\\nshall be consent, a search warrant, or reasonable suspicion that the search will produce evidence\\\nof a violation of the offender\\'s conditions of supervision.”105\\\nConsidering the foregoing, the Court concluded “the search of Gasaway\\'s truck was reasonable\\\nunder the totality of the circumstances. The Commonwealth clearly has a legitimate and\\\noverwhelming interest in the supervision of parolees. Gasaway\\'s reasonable expectation of\\\nprivacy was minimal, requiring only reasonable suspicion to justify a warrantless search on these\\\nfacts.”106 And here, the detective had a reasonable suspicion Gasaway’s truck contained\\\ncontraband.\\\nWould the search have been justified by the vehicle exception to the warrant requirement? No.\\\nWhile Gasaway’s truck was a readily mobile vehicle in a public place, the officers lacked probable\\\ncause to search the truck. There was no established nexus between what the officers knew at the\\\ntime and the truck sufficient to establish probable cause that the vehicle contained contraband\\\nor evidence of a crime. The officers here had only a reasonable suspicion.\\\nWould the search have been justified as a search incident to arrest? No. First, Gasaway was\\\nsecured and not within reaching distance of the vehicle’s contents. Second, the detective\\\ntestified he was looking for “other drugs” which may be in the vehicle, rather than evidence of\\\nthe crime for which Gasaway was arrested for—possession of heroin. Therefore, per the law set\\\nforth in Gant107, the search of the truck was not justified as a search incident to arrest.",

He returned to Chicago, rented another vehicle, and drove back to\\\nWisconsin. That rented vehicle was seen on the farm in the early morning of the 11th, and later\\\n94\\\n\\\n\\fthat morning, Dombrowski purchased two towels at a nearby store. During that evening,\\\nDombrowski was seen drinking heavily and had a wreck. He was picked up by a passing motorist\\\nand taken into Kewaskum, where two local officers picked him up to take him back to the wreck\\\nscene. They noticed he appeared to be drunk and gave conflicting information about the wreck.\\\nAt the scene, they investigated the wreck. Believing Chicago officers were required to carry their\\\nweapons at all times, they searched Dombrowski and found no weapon. While waiting for a towtruck, they searched the passenger area and glovebox of the rented vehicle, again finding no\\\nweapon. The vehicle was towed to a private garage, where it would be left outside. Dombrowski\\\nwas taken to the West Bend police station and arrested for drunken driving. Because of his\\\ninjuries from the wreck, he was then taken to the hospital. The officers stated he was impaired\\\nand “incoherent at times.” While at the hospital, he fell into a coma and was hospitalized, under\\\nguard. Another officer, Weiss, went back to the garage and again searched the rented vehicle,\\\nstill believing there might be a weapon in the vehicle.\\\nInside the vehicle, Officer Weiss found a book of Chicago police regulations and a flashlight that\\\nhad drops of what appeared to be blood on it. Opening the truck, he found numerous items\\\ncovered in type O blood; Dombrowski had type A. These items included clothing, including police\\\nuniform trousers, a nightstick with “Dombrowski” stamped on it, a raincoat, a towel, and a car\\\nmat. The blood on the mat was still moist. These items were collected as evidence. Eventually\\\nDombrowski informed the police that “he believed there was a body lying near the family picnic\\\narea at the north end of his brother’s farm.” They located the body of McKinney, and he was\\\nlater found to have been struck over the head and shot, dying in the early morning hours of the\\\n11th. McKinney had type O blood.\\\nDombrowski was convicted of murder. His conviction was upheld by the Wisconsin Supreme\\\nCourt.

    "fullText": "circumstance, thereby permitting law enforcement to enter a residence without a warrant?\\\nHOLDING\\\n\\\nNo.\\\n\\\nDISCUSSION The Fourth Amendment provides that “[t]he right of the people to be secure in\\\ntheir persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not\\\nbe violated.” As that text makes clear, “the ultimate touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is\\\n‘reasonableness.’”125 That standard “generally requires the obtaining of a judicial warrant”\\\nbefore a law enforcement officer can enter a home without permission.126 But not always: The\\\n“warrant requirement is subject to certain exceptions.”127\\\nExigent circumstances are one important exception. An officer may make a warrantless entry\\\nwhen “the exigencies of the situation” create a compelling law enforcement need.128 The\\\nexigent circumstances exception enables law enforcement officers to handle emergency\\\nsituations presenting a “compelling need for official action and no time to secure a warrant.”129\\\nOver the years, this Court has identified several such exigencies. An officer, for example, may\\\n“enter a home without a warrant to render emergency assistance to an injured occupant[,] to\\\nprotect an occupant from imminent injury,” or to ensure his own safety.130 So too, the police\\\nmay make a warrantless entry to “prevent the imminent destruction of evidence” or to “prevent\\\na suspect\\'s escape.”131 In those circumstances, the delay required to obtain a warrant would\\\nbring about “some real immediate and serious consequences”—and so the absence of a warrant\\\nis excused.132\\\n98\\\n\\\n\\fExigent circumstances “requires a court to examine whether an emergency justified a\\\nwarrantless search in each particular case.”133 Or put more curtly, the exception is “casespecific.”134 That approach reflects the nature of emergencies. Whether a “now or never\\\nsituation” actually exists depends upon facts on the ground.135 The issue is most naturally\\\nconsidered by “look[ing] to the totality of circumstances” confronting the officer as he decides to\\\nmake a warrantless entry.136\\\nThe United States Supreme Court continued to recognize that a person’s living space has the\\\ngreatest expectation of privacy under the Fourth Amendment. The Fourth Amendment is based\\\non the principle that the “right of a man to retreat into his own home and there be free from\\\nunreasonable government intrusion.”137 The Fourth Amendment thus “draw[s] a firm line at the\\\nentrance to the house.”138 What lies behind that line is of course not inviolable. An officer may\\\nalways enter a home with a proper warrant. Exigent circumstances allow even warrantless\\\nintrusions.139 But the contours of that or any other warrant exception permitting home entry are\\\n“jealously and carefully drawn,” in keeping with the “centuries-old principle” that the “home is\\\nentitled to special protection.”140\\\nThe Supreme Court held that misdemeanors are usually minor offenses, categorized by less\\\nviolent and less dangerous crimes. When a minor offense alone is involved, law enforcement\\\ndoes not usually face the kind of emergency that can justify a warrantless home entry. While\\\nflight could potentially necessitate quick action by police, the Supreme Court determined that\\\nevery case of misdemeanor flight does not pose immediate dangers of evidence destruction or\\\nfurther flight.\\\nAccordingly, the Fourth Amendment requires an assessment of the case-by-case exigences\\\narising from a misdemeanant’s flight. That approach will in many, if not most, cases allow a\\\nwarrantless home entry. When the totality of circumstances shows an emergency—such as\\\nimminent harm to others, a threat to the officer himself, destruction of evidence, or escape from\\\nthe home—the police may act without waiting. And those circumstances, as described just\\\nabove, include the flight itself. But the need to pursue a misdemeanant does not trigger a\\\ncategorical rule allowing home entry, even absent a law enforcement emergency. Accordingly,\\\nthe Supreme Court held that when nature of the crime, the nature of the flight, and surrounding\\\nfacts present no such exigency, officers must respect the sanctity of the home—which means the\\\nofficers must get a warrant.\\\nThe United States Supreme Court vacated the judgment of the California Court of Appeals.",

    "fullText": "watched a vehicle veer slowly onto the shoulder of a state highway for a few seconds, and then\\\n“jerk back onto the road.” Since Nebraska law prohibited driving on the shoulder, Struble\\\nexecuted a traffic stop. Along with Officer Struble was his K-9, Floyd. Rodriguez was driving the\\\nvehicle and Pollman occupied the front passenger seat.\\\nStruble approached on the passenger side. Rodriguez identified himself and explained that he\\\nswerved to avoid a pothole. Struble gathered the documents and asked Rodriguez to accompany\\\nhim back to the patrol vehicle. Rodriguez asked if he was required to do so, and “Struble\\\nanswered that he was not.” Rodriguez elected to stay in his own vehicle.

Struble returned to his car to do a records check on Pollman and\\\nrequested back-up. Struble wrote a warning ticket for the violation.

Floyd alerted on his second pass and, ultimately, a large bag of methamphetamine was\\\nfound. “All told, seven or eight minutes had elapsed from the time Struble issued the written\\\nwarning until the dog indicated the presence of drugs.”\\\nRodriguez was indicted in federal court for the methamphetamine.

The case was appealed, and the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear the\\\ncase.\\\n\\\n101\\\n\\\n\\fISSUE:\\\nMay a traffic stop be prolonged, absent at least reasonable suspicion, to allow for\\\na drug sniff by a K-9?\\\nHOLDING:\\\n\\\nNo.\\\n\\\nDISCUSSION: The Court agreed that a “seizure for a traffic violation justifies a police\\\ninvestigation of that violation,” and is more akin to a Terry stop than an arrest. “Like a Terry\\\nstop, the tolerable duration of police inquiries in the traffic-stop context is determined by the\\\nseizure’s “mission”—to address the traffic violation that warranted the stop.”141 “Authority for\\\nthe seizure thus ends when tasks tied to the traffic infraction are—or reasonably should have\\\nbeen—completed.” In both Caballes and Johnson, the Court emphasized that an unrelated\\\ninvestigation can be done, so long as it “did not lengthen the roadside detention.”142 Additional\\\ninquiries might include “checking the driver’s license, determining whether there are outstanding\\\nwarrants against the driver, and inspecting the automobile’s registration and proof of\\\ninsurance.”143 The Court noted, however, that a “dog sniff, by contrast, is a measure aimed at\\\n‘detect[ing] evidence of ordinary criminal wrongdoing.’”144 The Court noted that the critical\\\nquestion is “not whether the dog sniff occurs before or after the officer issues a ticket … but\\\nwhether conducting the sniff ‘prolongs’ … ‘the stop.’”\\\nThe United States Supreme Court vacated the Eighth Circuit’s decision and remanded for further\\\nproceedings.",

In addition, the\\\nCourt also noted that this does not prevent law enforcement authorities setting up an\\\nemergency roadblock to catch a fleeing criminal or to thwart imminent danger such as a terrorist\\\nattack.\\\nThe Court also said that this decision does not prevent law enforcement officers, while\\\nconducting a lawful roadblock, from arresting a motorist for a crime unrelated to the reason for\\\nthe roadblock. For example, while conducting a roadblock to check license and registration, if the\\\nofficer smelled marijuana, the officer would then have appropriate cause to check the vehicle for\\\nfurther evidence of marijuana possession.",
